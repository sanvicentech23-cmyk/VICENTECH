# Priest Calendar Testing Guide

## Current Status
✅ **API is working correctly**
✅ **Database has data**
✅ **Calendar entry exists**

## The Issue
The calendar entry is not showing in the priest dashboard because **the logged-in user is not the same priest that has the calendar entry**.

## Database Data
- **Calendar Entry**: Assigned to priest with ID 7 (priest1@gmail.com)
- **Date**: August 10, 2025
- **Duty**: mass
- **Time**: 14:48 (2:48 PM)

## Available Priests
1. **ID 7**: priest1 (priest1@gmail.com) - **HAS CALENDAR ENTRY**
2. **ID 17**: Fr. Gomer Torres (fr.gomer@church.com)
3. **ID 18**: Fr. Jeric Advincula (fr.jeric@church.com)

## How to Test Properly

### Step 1: Login as the Correct Priest
You need to login as **priest1** (priest1@gmail.com) to see the calendar entry.

### Step 2: Check Browser Console
Open browser developer tools and check the console. You should see:
```
Logged in user: {id: 7, name: "priest1", ...}
Fetching schedule for: {userId: 7, startDate: "2025-08-01", endDate: "2025-08-31"}
Schedule response: {success: true, data: {priest: {...}, schedule: [...]}}
Transformed schedule: [{date: "2025-08-10", event: "mass - 14:48", ...}]
```

### Step 3: Navigate to August 2025
Make sure you're viewing August 2025 in the calendar (the calendar entry is for August 10, 2025).

### Step 4: Click on August 10
Click on August 10, 2025 in the calendar to see the scheduled duty.

## Troubleshooting

### If No Data Shows:
1. **Check logged-in user**: Console should show user ID 7
2. **Check API response**: Console should show schedule data
3. **Check date**: Make sure you're viewing August 2025
4. **Check browser network tab**: Verify API calls are successful

### If Wrong User is Logged In:
1. Logout current user
2. Login as priest1@gmail.com
3. Navigate to priest dashboard

### If API Errors:
1. Check Laravel logs: `storage/logs/laravel.log`
2. Verify authentication token is valid
3. Check database connection

## Test API Directly

You can test the API directly:

### Test Database:
```
GET http://localhost:8000/api/test-db
```

### Test Priest Schedule:
```
GET http://localhost:8000/api/test-priest-schedule/7
```

### Test with Authentication:
```
GET http://localhost:8000/api/priest/my-schedule?start_date=2025-08-01&end_date=2025-08-31
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN
```

## Expected Result

When logged in as priest1 and viewing August 2025:
- August 10 should have a colored indicator
- Clicking August 10 should show: "mass - 14:48"
- Status should show as "Scheduled"
- Notes should show: "test"

## Creating More Test Data

To create more calendar entries for testing:
1. Go to Staff interface (PriestCalendar.jsx)
2. Create new entries for different priests and dates
3. Test with different priest accounts

## Summary

The system is working correctly. The issue is simply that you need to:
1. **Login as priest1** (the priest who has the calendar entry)
2. **View August 2025** (the month with the calendar entry)
3. **Click on August 10** (the date with the calendar entry)

The debugging logs I added will help you verify each step is working correctly.
